# Simulation-of-A-Dancing-Humanoid-in-MATLAB
This was done as a course project for my Computer Graphics course. This code represents a Kinematic Human Body Tracker developed in MATLAB. It utilizes Biovision Hierarchy (BVH) motion capture data to reconstruct and visualize a 3D skeletal model using non-linear least squares optimization.
